# house-price-prediction
Demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and model building for house price prediction using scikit-learn.

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts **house prices** based on features like area, number of rooms, and location.  
Built using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data analysis and regression modeling.

- Project Overview
- Uses housing data to train regression models for price prediction.  
- Includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.  
- Algorithms used: **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**.  
- Evaluates performance using **RÂ² Score**, **MAE**, and **RMSE** metrics.  

Output:
Displays predicted vs actual prices
Shows model accuracy metrics and data visualizations
